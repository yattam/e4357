What I have learned from this homework:
1) Learned Linux commands: I thought the Unix commands will work in Linux environment and vice versa and turned out it is not true.  

2) Learned about Ubuntu: environment has a feel of a window-os; GUI interface is pretty easy to navigate; I can see the potential of myself using this environment more.

3) Learned about the uVsion and GNU compiler:  for my class project, my partners and I decide to go with uVision since the majority of us use Window-os.
We will focus more on learning about uVision in the next few weeks.
