What is happening in the background?
The key strokes fires an interrupt, IO gets the string and passes it to the google client. 
It generates the search string according the user preferences, if there is one. 
After the string is generated, client makes the HTTP request. 
HTTP request converts the data to TCP/IP packets. The packets is sent to the google search engine server through the Ethernet. 
When google servers received the request, they return the best matching indexes according to their page ranking algorithm via the same protocol. 
If there is an encryption request, google handles it.
