This week I learned:

1) This week's homework is to connect two mbeds as show in Figure 7.13 on the book, and compile Program Example 7.9 into each.  
I am able to use the switches from one mbed board to control the LEDs on the other mbed board and vice versa.  The communication 
is estabilished between pin 9 and 10 (serves as TX and RX serial communication) on both mbed boards.

2) Last night in class, we went over firmware architecture and RTOS architecture.
